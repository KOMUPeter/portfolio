# Peter's Portfolio Application

Welcome to my portfolio! This application showcases my journey of learning and mastering React.js and Vite. I embarked on this self-directed learning adventure to enhance my skills and delve into the world of modern web development.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js:** I've crafted this application using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js enables me to create dynamic and responsive components, making the user experience seamless.

- **Vite:** The application is built with Vite, a fast and opinionated web development build tool that helped streamline my development process. Its efficiency and simplicity have been instrumental in bringing this portfolio to life.

## Learning Journey
Learning React.js and Vite has been an exciting challenge. I took the initiative to explore these technologies independently, driven by a passion for staying at the forefront of web development trends. This portfolio is not just a showcase of my competence with React.js but also a testament to my commitment to continuous learning.

## Why a Portfolio?
I decided to create this portfolio as a tangible representation of my skills and knowledge in React.js and Vite. It serves as a hub where I can demonstrate my projects, share my experiences, and highlight my proficiency in web development. The portfolio also acts as a living document, evolving as I continue to learn and explore new technologies.

Feel free to explore my projects, check out my skills, and get to know more about my journey in web development. Thank you for visiting!
